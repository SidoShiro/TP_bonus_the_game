Here a **begining** of a Makefile in order to have a good start.

```Makefile
CC = gcc
CFLAGS = -std=c99 -pedantic -Wextra -Wall -Werror -Iinclude
SRC_TETRIS = # put the tetris .c files here
SRC_TTFE = # put the twothousantfortyeight .c files here

all: # put here tetris or/and twothousandfortyeight

tetris:
          $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(SRC) -o tetris

twothousandfortyeight:
          $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(SRC) -o twothousandfortyeight

clean:
          $(RM) *.o tetris twothousantfortyeight
```

> /!\ You can choose to do *tetris* or/and *2048* (of course if you do the two games correctly your grade will be the best
